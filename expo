ðŸ“Œ Method 1: Build APK using EAS Build (Recommended)
Expo now uses EAS Build to generate APK files, replacing the old expo build:android command.

âœ… Step 1: Install EAS CLI
Run the following command in your project directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm install -g eas-cli
âœ… Step 2: Login to Expo
Make sure you are logged into Expo:

sh
Copy
Edit
eas login
âœ… Step 3: Configure EAS Build
Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
eas build:configure
This will create an eas.json file where build settings are stored.

âœ… Step 4: Build APK
Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
eas build -p android --profile preview
The preview profile creates an APK file (good for testing).

If you want an AAB file for Play Store, use --profile production.

âœ… Step 5: Download the APK
Once the build is completed, Expo will provide a link to download your APK.
